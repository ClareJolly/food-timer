# Food Timer


I created an app for my sister over Christmas as she was not happy with having to work out when to start cooking all the various parts of Christmas dinner.

Written in React JS and a work in progress at the moment - but it works and she used it :-)

To use it yourself, clone the repo and run `npm install` and `npm start`

It's also deployed at the following urls:
